Modified the original Decontaminator to be able to fit the Trident.

- Changed the extention arm to be able to hold on to the center bed extrusion.
- Changed the magnetic locking system to use a set of magnets instead of magnets and screws, in case the screws are not magnetic.
- Changed the brush holder to make it sit 5mm higher, creating a safer distance above the bed.

You need the following:
- 3D print the 3 STLs
- 1x brass brush (should be around 40mm in length, and less than 10mm in width)
- 2x 6x3mm round magnets
- 4x M3x8mm SHCS bolts
- 2x M3 nuts
- 2x M3 T-nuts
- 2x M2x8 self-tapping screws (**Optional**) (10mm is also fine)
- Scrubbing and purging printing macro found on the original mod page.
