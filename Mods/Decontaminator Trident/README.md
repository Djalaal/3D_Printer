Modified the original Decontaminator to be able to fit the Trident.

- Changed the extention arm to be able to hold on to the center bed extrusion.
- Changed the magnetic locking system to use a set of magnets instead of magnets and screws, in case the screws are not magnetic.
- Changed the brush holder to make it sit 5mm higher, creating a safer distance above the bed.
