Modified the original Decontaminator to be able to fit the Trident.
Changed the extention arm to be able to hold on to the center bed extrusion.
Changed the magnetic locking system to not use the screws, in case the screws are not magnetic (mine weren't).
Changed the brush holder to make it taller, so it sticks out slightly more above the bed.
